== YubiX VM

NOTE: This project is deprecated and is no longer being maintained.

Creates a virtual machine with YubiX installed, ready for distribution.

=== Dependencies
VM images are created by using vmbuilder under Ubuntu. You will need a 
Ubuntu installation with the python-vm-builder package installed.

=== Running
To create the virtual machine image, run build-vm.sh as root.

=== Testing
To run the tests, run the /root/test/run-tests.sh script as the root user 
on the virtual machine.


=== Race condition in vmbuilder
There is a known issue in vmbuilder which sometimes fails the build, printing an error: "/dev/mapper/loop0p1 does not exist".
To fix this you will need to make a modification int the following file: /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/VMBuilder/disk.py (location may vary).
Find the map_partitions method and change the following row:

  kpartx_output = run_cmd('kpartx', '-av', self.filename)

to the following (note the added 's' in the arguments):

  kpartx_output = run_cmd('kpartx', '-sav', self.filename)

Now, the build should succeed.
